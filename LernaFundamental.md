## **1. What is Lerna?**  
Lerna is a **monorepo management tool** that simplifies working with multiple JavaScript packages in a single repository. It optimizes workflows, making it easier to:  
- **Manage dependencies** between multiple packages  
- **Version and publish** multiple packages at once  
- **Run scripts** across multiple packages efficiently  
- **Improve performance** by linking packages locally  

Lerna is commonly used with **Node.js**, **npm**, and **Yarn**, making it ideal for large-scale projects with multiple interdependent modules.  

---

## **2. Why Use Lerna?**  
### ‚úÖ **Benefits of Lerna**  
- **Monorepo Structure**: Helps keep related packages in one repository, improving maintainability.  
- **Efficient Dependency Management**: Uses symlinks or hoisting to share dependencies, reducing duplication.  
- **Automated Versioning & Publishing**: Manages package versions and releases systematically.  
- **Parallel Task Execution**: Runs scripts across multiple packages concurrently.  
- **Scoped Package Execution**: Allows running commands on specific packages.  

### ‚ùå **When Not to Use Lerna?**  
- If you have **only one package** (Lerna is designed for managing multiple).  
- If you need strict **isolation between packages** (consider separate repositories instead).  
- If you are working with **non-JavaScript projects** (Lerna is optimized for JavaScript/Node.js).  

---

## **3. Installing Lerna**  
You can install Lerna globally or as a development dependency in your project.  

### **Global Installation**  
```sh
npm install -g lerna
```

### **Project-Specific Installation**  
```sh
npm install --save-dev lerna
```

---

## **4. Setting Up a Lerna Monorepo**  
### **Step 1: Initialize Lerna**  
Run the following command inside your project folder:  
```sh
lerna init
```
This will create a `lerna.json` file and a `packages/` directory.

### **Step 2: Add Packages**  
Create new package directories inside the `packages/` folder:  
```sh
mkdir packages/package-a packages/package-b
```

Each package should have its own `package.json`.  

### **Step 3: Bootstrap Packages**  
To install dependencies and link local packages, run:  
```sh
lerna bootstrap
```
This installs dependencies and creates symlinks between interdependent packages.  

---

## **5. Lerna Modes: Fixed vs. Independent**  
Lerna can manage package versions in two modes:  

### **üîµ Fixed Mode (Default)**  
- All packages share the same version.  
- Useful for projects that are meant to be released together.  

To use fixed mode, initialize with:  
```sh
lerna init
```

### **üü¢ Independent Mode**  
- Each package has its own version.  
- Useful when packages evolve separately.  

To use independent mode, run:  
```sh
lerna init --independent
```

---

## **6. Managing Dependencies**  
Lerna provides commands to manage dependencies easily.  

### **Add Dependencies to a Specific Package**  
```sh
lerna add lodash --scope=package-a
```

### **Add a Local Package as a Dependency**  
```sh
lerna add package-b --scope=package-a
```
This links `package-b` inside `package-a`.

### **Hoist Dependencies (Optimize Installs)**  
```sh
lerna bootstrap --hoist
```
This moves common dependencies to the root `node_modules` folder to avoid duplication.  

---

## **7. Running Scripts in All Packages**  
Lerna can run commands in multiple packages at once.  

### **Run a Script in All Packages**  
```sh
lerna run test
```
This runs `npm test` in each package that has it.  

### **Run a Script in a Specific Package**  
```sh
lerna run build --scope=package-a
```
Runs `npm run build` only in `package-a`.  

### **Run Scripts in Parallel**  
```sh
lerna run build --parallel
```
Runs build scripts in all packages simultaneously.

---

## **8. Versioning & Publishing Packages**  
Lerna makes versioning and publishing easy.

### **Check for Changes**  
```sh
lerna changed
```
Lists packages that have changed since the last release.

### **Versioning**  
```sh
lerna version
```
- Prompts for version updates.  
- Updates `package.json` and creates a Git commit & tag.  

For **independent versions**, use:  
```sh
lerna version --independent
```

### **Publish to npm**  
```sh
lerna publish
```
Publishes all updated packages to npm.

To publish only **a specific package**, use:  
```sh
lerna publish --scope=package-a
```

---

## **9. Lerna with Yarn & PNPM**  
Lerna works with **Yarn Workspaces** and **PNPM** for better dependency management.

### **Using Lerna with Yarn Workspaces**  
1. Enable Yarn workspaces in `package.json`:  
```json
{
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
}
```
2. Modify `lerna.json` to use Yarn:  
```json
{
  "npmClient": "yarn",
  "useWorkspaces": true
}
```

3. Run:  
```sh
lerna bootstrap
```
This installs dependencies using Yarn workspaces.

### **Using Lerna with PNPM**  
Modify `lerna.json`:  
```json
{
  "npmClient": "pnpm",
  "useWorkspaces": true
}
```
Then, run:  
```sh
lerna bootstrap
```

## **10. Alternatives to Lerna**  
While Lerna is widely used, some alternatives offer similar features:  

| Tool | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Nx** | Advanced monorepo management, caching, task running |
| **Turborepo** | Faster builds and task execution |
| **Yarn Workspaces** | Simple monorepo setup without additional tools |
| **PNPM Workspaces** | Efficient package linking with minimal disk usage |

Lerna is often combined with **Yarn or PNPM** for optimal performance.

---

## **11. Should You Use Lerna in 2025?**  
Lerna is still a **useful tool**, but its development has slowed. The maintainers recommend using **Nx or Turborepo** for modern monorepos. However, Lerna still works well, especially when combined with **Yarn or PNPM Workspaces**.

**‚úÖ Use Lerna if:**
- You need a simple monorepo setup.
- You‚Äôre already using npm or Yarn.
- You prefer classic dependency management.

**üöÄ Consider Nx or Turborepo if:**
- You need advanced caching and task execution.
- Your project is large and complex.
